# New Game Button Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When players were in an active game and clicked the "New Game" button in GameControls, nothing was happening. The players were set and there was an active game, but clicking "New Game" had no effect.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `TicTacToe.tsx` component on line 130. The `GameControls` component was receiving the wrong function for the `onNewGame` prop:

```tsx
// BEFORE (incorrect)
<GameControls
  onNewGame={() => setShowNameForm(false)}  // ❌ This just hides the form
  onResetGame={handleResetGame}
  gameId={game.game_id}
  isGameOver={game.is_game_over}
/>
```

This meant that when users clicked "New Game", it would only call `setShowNameForm(false)`, which had no visible effect since the name form wasn't shown when there was an active game.

## Solution
Fixed the `onNewGame` prop to call the correct `handleNewGame` function:

```tsx
// AFTER (correct)
<GameControls
  onNewGame={handleNewGame}  // ✅ This calls the proper new game logic
  onResetGame={handleResetGame}
  gameId={game.game_id}
  isGameOver={game.is_game_over}
/>
```

## Enhanced Logic
Also improved the `handleNewGame` function to better handle the case when there's already an active game:

```tsx
const handleNewGame = async () => {
  if (showNameForm) {
    await createGame({ player1_name: player1Name, player2_name: player2Name });
    setShowNameForm(false);
  } else {
    // If there's an active game, start a new game with the same player names
    // If no active game, show the name form
    if (game) {
      // Use the current game's player names for the new game
      await createGame({ 
        player1_name: game.player1_name, 
        player2_name: game.player2_name 
      });
    } else {
      setShowNameForm(true);
    }
  }
};
```

## User Experience
Now when users click "New Game" during an active game:

1. ✅ A new game is immediately created
2. ✅ Player names are preserved from the current game
3. ✅ The board is reset to a clean state
4. ✅ The game starts with the first player's turn
5. ✅ The new game has a unique game ID

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:
- `test_ui_new_game.js` - Simulates the exact user flow and verifies all aspects work correctly
- `test_new_game_functionality.js` - Tests the API-level new game creation
- All tests pass ✅

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/TicTacToe.tsx` - Fixed the onNewGame prop and enhanced handleNewGame logic
- Added test files to verify the functionality

The New Game button now works as expected! 🎉
