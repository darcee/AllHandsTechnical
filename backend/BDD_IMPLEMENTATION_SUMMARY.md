## 🧪 Test Coverage

### 14 Scenarios Implemented:
1. **Create a new game** - Basic game initialization
2. **Set custom player names** - Player name customization
3. **Player X makes the first move** - First move mechanics
4. **Player O makes a move** - Turn alternation
5. **Named players make moves** - Custom names in gameplay
6. **Player X wins with a horizontal line** - Horizontal win detection
7. **Player O wins with a vertical line** - Vertical win detection
8. **Player X wins with a diagonal line** - Diagonal win detection
9. **Named player wins the game** - Win with custom player names
10. **Game ends in a draw** - Draw condition detection
11. **Invalid move - position already occupied** - Move validation
12. **Invalid move - out of turn** - Turn validation
13. **Invalid move - game already over** - Game state validation
14. **Reset Game** - Game reset functionality

### 74 Step Definitions:
- **Given** steps: Game state setup and preconditions
- **When** steps: Player actions and game interactions
- **Then** steps: Expected outcomes and assertions

## 🎮 Game Features Implemented

### Core Functionality:
- ✅ 3x3 game board initialization
- ✅ Unique game ID generation
- ✅ Turn-based gameplay (X goes first)
- ✅ Move validation (position occupied, out of turn, game over)
- ✅ Win condition detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- ✅ Draw condition detection
- ✅ Game reset functionality

### Advanced Features:
- ✅ Custom player names support
- ✅ Named player turn tracking
- ✅ Named player win announcements
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Game state management

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Dependencies:
- `behave==1.2.6` - BDD testing framework
- `fastapi==0.115.13` - Web framework (ready for API implementation)
- `uvicorn==0.34.3` - ASGI server
- `pydantic==2.11.5` - Data validation

### Game Logic:
- **TicTacToeGame class** - Core game engine
- **Board representation** - 3x3 matrix with None/X/O values
- **Win detection** - Checks rows, columns, and diagonals
- **Draw detection** - Full board with no winner
- **Move validation** - Position, turn, and game state checks

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Method 1: Direct Behave
```bash
cd backend
behave
```

### Method 2: Test Runner Script
```bash
cd backend
python3 run_tests.py
```

### Method 3: Specific Scenario
```bash
cd backend
behave --name="Game ends in a draw"
```

## 📊 Test Results

74 steps passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 undefined
```

## 🎯 BDD-Spec-Partner Principles Applied

### ✅ Safety-First:
- Comprehensive test coverage before implementation
- All edge cases and error conditions tested
- Validation for invalid moves and game states

### ✅ Collaborative Workflow:
- Clear, readable Gherkin scenarios
- Business-friendly language in feature descriptions
- Step definitions that match natural language

### ✅ Explicit Approval:
- Each scenario explicitly defines expected behavior
- Clear assertions for all game states
- Comprehensive validation of game rules

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. **FastAPI Integration** - Create REST API endpoints
2. **Frontend Development** - Build web interface
3. **Database Integration** - Persist game states
4. **Multiplayer Support** - Real-time gameplay
5. **Authentication** - User management system

## 🏆 Achievement
Successfully created a complete BDD test suite with 100% passing tests, providing a solid foundation for tic-tac-toe game development using behavior-driven methodology.
