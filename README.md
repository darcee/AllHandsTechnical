# All-Hands Technical Project
where Darcee Thomason creates a tic-tac-toe game using FastAPI, React and OpenHands -- while writting very little code.


##  To run the program

## Backend
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/darcee/AllHandsTechnical.git
cd AllHandsTechnical/backend

1. Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt

1. Run BDD tests   
python3 run_tests.py or behave

1. Start the API server  
python3 start_api.py

1. Run API tests (in another terminal)  
python3 test_api.py

## Frontend
open a new terminal  
cd AllHandsTechnical/frontend 
1. Install  
npm install

1. Start development server  
npm run dev

##  Approach
I built this with FastAPI and React.   I wanted to use BDD for the basic build and provide set instructions to OpenHands to do this.
I feel this was mostly successful, thought it does seem a bit odd to have written almost no actual code while creating this.  
Not sure if that is what you are going for or not - but it was fun.

Once I had the API working I let the agent build more independently just to see where it went.  

At the end I used JetBrains AI Coding assistant a little to find an error in React. 

There is a bit of trade-off in letting the AI do as much of the code as I did.   In a way I would rather redo it and handle more of the code myself.  But I was able to do more of the project this way.

I was a bit surprised at how enthusiatically
